## Additional Note

The design and the requirements was conflicting or was not clear enough, or had some mis terminologys used.

If you want to render the traditional Pagiation, which is what was mentioned on the requirement, then you can use the repo as easy.

If you want to render the `Load more` style of pagination, render the post listing from `blog-post-listing-view-load-more.tsx`
